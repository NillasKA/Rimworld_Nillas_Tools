A mod's Preview.png is used as the preview image for that mod in both the in-game mod manager as well as Steam Workshop. 
It is strongly recommended to use a 640x360 PNG file as this is the default size and aspect ratio (16/9) 
configured for RimWorld and using other sizes may result in blurring or letterboxing. 
You can also opt to use 1280x720 for higher resolution artwork, 
but preview files must remain under 1MB or Steam Workshop will reject your upload. 
If you get a "limit exceeded" error, then double-check the size of your Preview.png.

Note: While PNG files are standard, RimWorld does not actually require a PNG file. 
It is possible to use JPG or even animated GIF files by simply renaming them "Preview.png", 
but the PNG extension must be used or RimWorld will not recognize it.
